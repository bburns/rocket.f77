
Rocket
======

A partially functional Fortran rocket from 1987. It reaches nearly 10km in about a minute before falling to earth. It simulates the mass, propellant, air resistance, and gravity. The output is a set of data files which were fed to a printer which used pens moving around on an x-y axis.
